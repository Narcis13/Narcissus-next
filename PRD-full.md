# Product Requirements Document: FlowForge AI

## Executive Summary

FlowForge AI is a revolutionary workflow automation platform that bridges the gap between traditional no-code automation tools and AI-driven systems. Built on the principle that "code is data," it enables users to create, discover, and run self-aware workflows that can evolve at runtime. The platform serves dual purposes: as a fully-featured SaaS for workflow automation enthusiasts and businesses, and as a boilerplate framework for developers building AI-powered applications.

## Vision Statement
