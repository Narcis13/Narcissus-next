## Implementation Summary

### Authentication System Setup (Completed)

#### Main Steps Taken:

1. **Installed Dependencies**
   - NextAuth.js v5 (beta) for authentication
   - bcryptjs for password hashing
   - react-hook-form and zod for form validation
   - @hookform/resolvers for form schema validation

2. **Created Authentication Configuration**
   - Set up NextAuth.js with credentials provider in `src/auth.ts`
   - Configured JWT session strategy with 30-day expiration
   - Added custom session callbacks to include user ID

3. **Implemented Password Security**
   - Created password utilities in `src/lib/auth/password.ts`
   - Password requirements: 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char
   - Used bcrypt with 10 salt rounds for hashing

4. **Set Up Middleware**
   - Created middleware in `src/middleware.ts` for route protection
   - Redirects unauthenticated users to login page
   - Redirects authenticated users away from auth pages

5. **Created UI Components**
   - Login page with email/password validation
   - Signup page with password requirements display
   - Profile page with user info and forms
   - Dashboard page for authenticated users

6. **Implemented User Management**
   - Server actions for user creation and profile updates
   - Change password functionality with current password verification
   - Profile update capability

7. **Updated Layout**
   - Added SessionProvider wrapper
   - Dynamic navigation based on auth status
   - Sign out functionality in navigation

#### Key Files Created:
- `src/auth.ts` - NextAuth configuration
- `src/middleware.ts` - Route protection
- `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - Auth API handler
- `src/lib/auth/password.ts` - Password utilities
- `src/lib/auth/signup.ts` - User creation logic
- `src/lib/auth/profile-actions.ts` - Profile management
- `src/app/login/page.tsx` - Login page

### Workflow Data Model Implementation (Completed)

#### What Was Implemented:

1. **TypeScript Type Definitions** (`src/lib/workflow/types/`)
   - **Base Types** (`base.ts`): Core enums and interfaces for data types, categories, statuses
   - **Node Types** (`node.ts`): Complete node system with inputs, outputs, edges, and execution
   - **Connection Types** (`connection.ts`): Connection definitions with validation support
   - **Workflow Types** (`workflow.ts`): Main workflow structure with config, triggers, and templates
   - **Execution Types** (`execution.ts`): Execution context and runtime services

2. **JSON Schema Validation** (`src/lib/workflow/schemas/`)
   - Created comprehensive JSON schema for workflow validation
   - Supports all workflow components: nodes, connections, variables, inputs/outputs, triggers
   - Includes nested definitions for complex structures

3. **Validation Implementation** (`src/lib/workflow/validation/`)
   - **WorkflowValidator**: Complete workflow validation with schema and business rules
   - **ConnectionValidator**: Connection-specific validation including:
     - Type compatibility checking
     - Circular dependency detection using DFS
     - Port validation
     - Required connection checking
   - Uses AJV for JSON schema validation

4. **Example Implementation** (`src/lib/workflow/examples/`)
   - Created example workflow demonstrating HTTP request, conditional logic, and data transformation
   - Shows how to define nodes and validate workflows
   - Includes programmatic workflow creation

#### Key Features:

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive interfaces
- **Flexible Node System**: Supports multiple input/output ports, edges for branching, and custom validation
- **Connection Validation**: Type checking, circular dependency detection, and connection rules
- **Execution Context**: Rich context with state management, logging, events, and flow control
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new node types and validation rules
- **JSON Schema**: Industry-standard validation with AJV

#### Architecture Highlights:

1. **Modular Structure**: Types, validation, and schemas are separated for clarity
2. **Comprehensive Validation**: Both structural (JSON schema) and logical (business rules)
3. **AI-Friendly**: Nodes include AI prompt hints for better discovery
4. **Production Ready**: Includes retry policies, error handling, and resource limits

The workflow data model provides a solid foundation for building the execution engine and UI components.
