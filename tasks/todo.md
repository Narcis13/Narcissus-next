### Workflow Data Model Implementation (Completed)

#### What Was Implemented:

1. **TypeScript Type Definitions** (`src/lib/workflow/types/`)
   - **Base Types** (`base.ts`): Core enums and interfaces for data types, categories, statuses
   - **Node Types** (`node.ts`): Complete node system with inputs, outputs, edges, and execution
   - **Connection Types** (`connection.ts`): Connection definitions with validation support
   - **Workflow Types** (`workflow.ts`): Main workflow structure with config, triggers, and templates
   - **Execution Types** (`execution.ts`): Execution context and runtime services

2. **JSON Schema Validation** (`src/lib/workflow/schemas/`)
   - Created comprehensive JSON schema for workflow validation
   - Supports all workflow components: nodes, connections, variables, inputs/outputs, triggers
   - Includes nested definitions for complex structures

3. **Validation Implementation** (`src/lib/workflow/validation/`)
   - **WorkflowValidator**: Complete workflow validation with schema and business rules
   - **ConnectionValidator**: Connection-specific validation including:
     - Type compatibility checking
     - Circular dependency detection using DFS
     - Port validation
     - Required connection checking

- **Connection Validation**: Type checking, circular dependency detection, and connection rules
- **Execution Context**: Rich context with state management, logging, events, and flow control
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new node types and validation rules
- **JSON Schema**: Industry-standard validation with AJV

#### Architecture Highlights:

1. **Modular Structure**: Types, validation, and schemas are separated for clarity
2. **Comprehensive Validation**: Both structural (JSON schema) and logical (business rules)
3. **AI-Friendly**: Nodes include AI prompt hints for better discovery
4. **Production Ready**: Includes retry policies, error handling, and resource limits

The workflow data model provides a solid foundation for building the execution engine and UI components.

---

### Execution Engine Implementation (Completed)

#### What Was Implemented:

1. **Dual Execution Mode Architecture**
   - **ImmediateExecutionStrategy**: Runs workflows synchronously in API handlers (< 10 nodes, < 30s)
   - **QueuedExecutionStrategy**: Uses BullMQ/Redis for complex workflows
   - **ExecutionManager**: Automatically selects optimal mode based on workflow complexity

2. **Workflow Complexity Analysis** (`ComplexityAnalyzer`)
   - Analyzes node count, external calls, loops, parallel paths
   - Estimates execution duration
   - Auto-decides between immediate vs queued execution

3. **Execution Persistence**
   - Database tracking of all executions
   - Step-by-step progress tracking
   - Error handling and status updates
   - Execution mode and metadata storage

4. **API Endpoints**
   - `POST /api/workflow/run` - Start workflow with mode selection
   - `GET /api/workflow/execution/{id}` - Get execution status
   - `DELETE /api/workflow/execution/{id}` - Cancel execution
   - `POST /api/workflow/execution/{id}/pause` - Pause execution
   - `POST /api/workflow/execution/{id}/resume` - Resume execution
   - `GET /api/workflow/execution/{id}/progress` - Get progress
   - `GET /api/workflow/execution/{id}/stream` - SSE for real-time updates

5. **BullMQ Worker**
   - Standalone worker process (`npm run worker`)
   - Processes queued workflows with FlowManager
   - Progress tracking and error handling
   - Graceful shutdown support

6. **Key Features**
   - Preserves existing FlowManager execution for immediate mode
   - Seamless mode switching based on complexity
   - Works with Vercel serverless (immediate mode)
   - Scalable with Redis queues (queued mode)
   - Real-time progress updates via SSE

#### Architecture Benefits:
- Simple workflows run instantly without queue overhead
- Complex workflows won't timeout on serverless platforms
- Automatic mode selection removes complexity from users
- Full execution history and debugging capabilities
- Ready for production deployment

The dual execution mode ensures optimal performance for both simple and complex workflows while maintaining compatibility with serverless platforms like Vercel.

### Core Node Implementation (Completed)

#### What Was Implemented:

1. **Understanding the FlowManager System**
   - Analyzed existing FlowManager.js implementation
   - Created comprehensive synthesis document at `src/lib/flow-engine/FLOWMANAGER_SYNTHESIS.md`
   - Identified key differences from initial TypeScript approach:
     - Nodes use `implementation` function, not `execute`
     - Must return edges (string or object with edge functions)
     - Context accessed via `this` in implementation
     - CommonJS modules, not ES6/TypeScript

2. **Logic Nodes** (`src/lib/flow-engine/nodes/logic/`)
   - **Conditional Branch** (`logic.condition.if`): Full comparison operators, true/false branching
   - **Delay** (`logic.control.delay`): Configurable delays up to 5 minutes
   - **Loop Controller** (`logic.control.loop`): Count/condition/array modes for FlowManager loops

3. **Data Nodes** (`src/lib/flow-engine/nodes/data/`)
   - **Transform** (`data.transform.mapper`): Extract, map, filter, reduce, custom operations
   - **Merge** (`data.combine.merge`): Multiple merge strategies with conflict resolution

4. **Documentation**
   - FlowManager synthesis document for future reference
   - Implemented nodes documentation with usage examples
   - Test file demonstrating all new nodes

#### Key Learnings:
- FlowManager uses a unique execution model with edge-based flow control
- Nodes can be called via string reference, parameterized objects, or direct functions
- Loop syntax uses double arrays `[[controller, ...actions]]`
- Branching uses object notation with edge names as keys
- State management is built-in with path notation support

The node system is now ready for additional implementations following the established patterns.
