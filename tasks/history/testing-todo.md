# Agentic Workflow System Testing Plan

## System Overview
The NextProject is an AI-friendly agentic workflow management system (similar to n8n/make.com) with JSON-based workflow definitions. The system is designed to be highly composable and serializable for AI agents to create and execute complex automations.

## Core Features Discovered

### 1. Flow Engine Architecture
- **FlowManager**: Main execution engine with state management, event emission, and execution context
- **FlowHub**: Singleton event system for cross-flow communication and pause/resume capabilities
- **NodeRegistry**: Node registration, discovery, and scope management
- **TriggerManager**: Automation trigger system for event-driven workflows

### 2. Node Types Implemented
- **Text Processing**: 
  - `text.transform.toUpperCase`: String transformation
  - `text.analysis.sentiment`: Sentiment analysis (implementation TBD)
- **Utilities**:
  - `utils.log.message`: Logging functionality
- **Google Integration**:
  - `google.gmail.connect`: OAuth authentication
  - `google.gmail.listEmails`: Email listing with optional full details
  - `google.gdrive.uploadFile`: File upload
  - `google.gdrive.downloadFile`: File download
  - `google.gdrive.listFiles`: File listing

### 3. Workflow Features
- **State Management**: Full state with undo/redo capabilities
- **State Placeholders**: Dynamic value resolution using `${state.path}` syntax
- **Branching**: Conditional execution based on edge names
- **Loops**: Controller-based iteration with action nodes
- **Sub-flows**: Nested workflow execution
- **Parameterized Calls**: Node execution with parameters
- **Human Input**: Pause/resume capabilities for user interaction
- **Event System**: Custom event emission and listening within flows

### 4. Trigger System
- **Email Trigger**: Mock implementation for email-based automation
- **Event Trigger**: General event-based automation
- **Automation Registration**: Dynamic workflow activation based on triggers
